## 1. Project Overview <a name="project-overview"></a>
This repository provides a time-series forecasting approach to predict the electricity demand in the United Kingdom (UK). The repository includes various models and techniques specifically designed for forecasting electricity demand, taking into account historical data, seasonal patterns, and other relevant factors. The repository also provides data preprocessing scripts, model evaluation metrics, and example notebooks to guide users in understanding and implementing the forecasting approach. The goal of this repository is to assist researchers, data scientists, and energy professionals in accurately predicting electricity demand in the UK, enabling better planning and decision-making in the energy sector.

## 2. Data Description <a name="data-description"></a>
The dataset provided by the UK National Grid operator includes observations of electricity demand (in megawatts) measured in each half-hour of a day from January 2009 until April 2023. Additionally, weather data obtained from the visual crossing web site includes average daily temperature, humidity, windspeed, and other weather variables. Missing values were filled, and cyclic seasonal features were transformed using sine and cosine functions.
The dataset consists of two separate files: one for electricity demand data and the other for weather data.

### Electricity Demand Data:
| Variable          | Description                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| datetime          | Timestamp of the observation      |
| electricity_demand| Electricity demand in megawatts   |
| ...               | Other relevant variables          |

### Weather Data:
| Variable          | Description                       |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------|
| datetime          | Timestamp of the observation      |
| temperature       | Average daily temperature         |
| humidity          | Humidity                          |
| windspeed         | Windspeed                         |
| ...               | Other relevant weather variables  |
